# PART I: THE INDUSTRY
## Chapter 1: picking a bug bounty program
### The state of the industry
- In 1995, Netscape launched the first-ever bug bounty program. The company encouraged users to report bugs found in its brand-new browser, the Netscape Navigator 2.0, introducing the idea of crowdsourced security testing to the internet world. Mozilla launched the next corporate bug bounty program nine years later, in 2004, inviting users to identify bugs in the Firefox browser
- But it was not until the 2010s that offering bug bounties become a popular practice. That year, Google launched its program, and Facebook followed suit in 2011. These two programs kick-started the trend of using bug bounties to augment a corporation’s in-house security infrastructure.
- The two largest of these platforms, HackerOne and Bugcrowd, both launched in 2012.
### Asset types
- In the context of a bug bounty program, an asset is an application, website, or product that you can hack.
- There are different types of assets, each with its own characteristics, requirements, and pros and cons. After considering these differences, you should choose a program with assets that play to your strengths, based on your skill set, experience level, and preferences.
#### Social sites and applications
- Anything labeled social has a lot of potential for vulnerabilities, because these applications tend to be complex and involve a lot of interaction among users, and between the user and the server. That’s why the first type of bug bounty program we’ll talk about targets social websites and applications. The term social application refers to any site that allows users to interact with each other. Many programs belong to this category: examples include the bug bounty program for HackerOne and programs for Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and LINE.

- Social applications need to manage interactions among users, as well as each user’s roles, privileges, and account integrity. They are typically full of potential for critical web vulnerabilities such as insecure direct object references (IDORs), info leaks, and account takeovers. These vulnerabilities occur when many users are on a platform, and when applications mismanage user information; when the application does not validate a user’s identity properly, malicious users can assume the identity of others.

- These complex applications also often provide a lot of user input opportunities. If input validation is not performed properly, these applications are prone to injection bugs, like SQL injection (SQLi) or cross-site scripting (XSS). If you are a newcomer to bug bounties, I recommend that you start with social sites. The large number of social applications nowadays means that if you target social sites, you’ll have many programs to choose from.

- Also, the complex nature of social sites means that you’ll encounter a vast attack surface with which to experiment. (An application’s attack surface refers to all of the application’s different points that an attacker can attempt to exploit.) Finally, the diverse range of vulnerabilities that show up on these sites means that you will be able to quickly build a deep knowledge of web security.

- The skill set you need to hack social programs includes the ability to use a proxy, like the Burp Suite proxy introduced in Chapter 4, and knowledge about web vulnerabilities such as XSS and IDOR. You can learn more about these in Chapters 6 and 10. It’s also helpful to have some JavaScript programming skills and knowledge about web development. 
- However, these skills aren’t required to succeed as a hacker. But these programs have a major ***DOWNSIDE***. Because of the popularity of their products and the low barrier of entry, they’re often very competitive and have many hackers hunting on them. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are some of the most targeted programs.
#### General web applications
- General web applications are also a good target for beginners. Here, I am referring to any web applications that do not involve user-to-user interaction. Instead, users interact with the server to access the application’s features. Targets that fall into these categories can include static websites, cloud applications, consumer services like banking sites, and web portals of Internet of Things (IoT) devices or other connected hardware.

- That said, in my experience, they tend to be a little more difficult to hack than social applications, and their attack surface is smaller. If you’re looking for account takeovers and info leak vulnerabilities, you won’t have as much luck because there aren’t a lot of opportunities for users to interact with others and potentially steal their information

- You’ll need to look for server-side vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities specific to the application’s technology stack. You could also look for commonly found network vulnerabilities, like subdomain takeovers. This means you’ll have to know about both client-side and server-side web vulnerabilities, and you should have the ability to use a proxy. It’s also helpful to have some knowledge about web development and programming. These programs can range in popularity. However, most of them have a low barrier of entry, so you can most likely get started hacking right away!

#### Mobile Applications (Android, iOS, and Windows)
- After you get the hang of hacking web applications, you may choose to specialize in mobile applications. Mobile programs are becoming prevalent; after all, most web apps have a mobile equivalent nowadays. They include programs for Facebook Messenger, the Twitter app, the LINE mobile app, the Yelp app, and the Gmail app. 

- Hacking mobile applications requires the skill set you’ve built from hacking web applications, as well as additional knowledge about the structure of mobile apps and programming techniques related to the platform. You should understand attacks and analysis strategies like certificate pinning bypass, mobile reverse engineering, and cryptography. 

- Hacking mobile applications also requires a little more setup than hacking web applications, as you’ll need to own a mobile device that you can experiment on. A good mobile testing lab consists of a regular device, a rooted device, and device emulators for both Android and iOS. 
	- A rooted device is one for which you have admin privileges. It will allow you to experiment more freely, because you can bypass the mobile system’s safety constraints. An emulator is a virtual simulation of mobile environments that you run on your computer. It allows you to run multiple device versions and operating systems without owning a device for each setup. 
- For these reasons, mobile applications are less popular among bug bounty hunters than web applications. However, the higher barrier of entry for mobile programs is an advantage for those who do participate. These programs are less competitive, making it relatively easy to find bugs.
#### APIs
- Application programming interfaces (APIs) are specifications that define how other applications can interact with an organization’s assets, such as to retrieve or alter their data. For example, another application might be able to retrieve an application’s data via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages to a certain endpoint, and the application will return data in the format of Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) messages. 
- Some programs put a heightened focus on API bugs in their bug bounty programs if they’re rolling out a new version of their API. A secure API implementation is key to preventing data breaches and protecting customer data. Hacking APIs requires many of the same skills as hacking web applications, mobile applications, and IoT applications. But when testing APIs, you should focus on common API bugs like data leaks and injection flaws.
#### Source Code and Executables
- If you have more advanced programming and reversing skills, you can give source code and executable programs a try. These programs encourage hackers to find vulnerabilities in an organization’s software by directly providing hackers with an open source codebase or the binary executable. Examples include the Internet Bug Bounty, the program for the PHP language, and the WordPress program.
- Hacking these programs can entail analyzing the source code of open source projects for web vulnerabilities and fuzzing binaries for potential exploits. You usually have to understand coding and computer science concepts to be successful here. You’ll need knowledge of web vulnerabilities, programming skills related to the project’s codebase, and code analysis skills. Cryptography, software development, and reverse engineering skills are helpful. 
- Source code programs may sound intimidating, but keep in mind that they’re diverse, so you have many to choose from. You don’t have to be a master programmer to hack these programs; rather, aim for a solid understanding of the project’s tech stack and underlying architecture. Because these programs tend to require more skills, they are less competitive, and only a small proportion of hackers will ever attempt them.
#### Hardware IoT
- Last but not least are hardware and IoT programs. These programs ask you to hack devices like cars, smart televisions, and thermostats. Examples include the bug bounty programs of Tesla and Ford Motor Company. You’ll need highly specific skills to hack these programs: 
	- you’ll often have to acquire a deep familiarity with the type of device that you’re hacking, in addition to understanding common IoT vulnerabilities. You should know about web vulnerabilities, programming, code analysis, and reverse engineering. Also, study up on IoT concepts and industry standards such as digital signing and asymmetric encryption schemes. Finally, cryptography, wireless hacking, and software development skills will be helpful too.
-  Since these programs require specialized skills and a device, they tend to be the least competitive.
### Bug Bounty Platforms
- Bug bounty platforms are websites through which many companies host their programs. Usually, the platform directly awards hackers with reputation points and money for their results. Some of the largest bug bounty platforms are HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, Synack, and Cobalt.
- From the hacker’s perspective, bug bounty platforms provide a centralized place to submit reports. They also offer a seamless way to get recognized and paid for your findings. On the other hand, many organizations host and manage their bug bounty programs without the help of platforms. Companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, and Medium do this. You can find their bug bounty policy pages by visiting their websites, or by searching “CompanyName bug bounty program” online.
#### PROS
- The best thing about bug bounty platforms is that they provide a lot of transparency into a company’s process, because they post disclosed reports, metrics about the programs’ triage rates, payout amounts, and response times. Independently hosted programs often lack this type of transparency. In the bug bounty world, triage refers to the confirmation of vulnerability
- Bug bounty programs also often have reputation systems that allow you to showcase your experience so you can gain access to invite-only bug bounty programs. Another pro of bug bounty platforms is that they often step in to provide conflict resolution and legal protection as a third party. If you submit a report to a non-platform program, you have no recourse in the final bounty decision.
- Ultimately, you can’t always expect companies to pay up or resolve reports in the current state of the industry, but the hacker-to-hacker feedback system that platforms provide is helpful.
#### CONS
- However, some hackers avoid bug bounty platforms because they dislike how those platforms deal with reports. Reports submitted to platformmanaged bug bounty programs often get handled by triagers, third-party employees who often aren’t familiar with all the security details about a company’s product. Complaints about triagers handling reports improperly are common.
- Programs on platforms also break the direct connection between hackers and developers. With a direct program, you often get to discuss the vulnerability with a company’s security engineers, making for a great learning experience.
- Finally, public programs on bug bounty platforms are often crowded, because the platform gives them extra exposure. On the other hand, many privately hosted programs don’t get as much attention from hackers and are thus less competitive. And for the many companies that do not contract with bug bounty platforms, you have no choice but to go off platforms if you want to participate in their programs.
### Scope, Payouts, and Response Times
- you consider when picking a program, besides its asset types and platform? On each bug bounty program’s page, metrics are often listed to help you assess the program. These metrics give insight into how easily you might be able to find bugs, how much you might get paid, and how well the program operates.
#### Scope
- Program Scope First, consider the scope. A program’s scope on its policy pages specifies what and how you are allowed to hack. There are two types of scopes: asset and vulnerability. The asset scope tells you which subdomain, products, and applications you can hack. And the vulnerability scope specifies which vulnerabilities the company will accept as valid bugs.
- Any program with large asset and vulnerability scopes is a good place to start for a beginner. The larger the asset scope, the larger the number of target applications and web pages you can look at. When a program has a big asset scope, you can often find obscure applications that are overlooked by other hackers. 
	- This typically means less competition when reporting bugs. The larger the vulnerability scope, the more types of bugs the organization is willing to hear reports about. These programs are a lot easier to find bugs in, because you have more opportunities, and so can play to your strengths.
#### Payouts
- The next metric you should consider is the program’s payout amounts. There are two types of payment programs: 
	- vulnerability disclosure programs (VDPs) and bug bounty programs. VDPs are reputation-only programs, meaning they do not pay for findings but often offer rewards such as reputation points and swag. They are a great way to learn about hacking if making money is not your primary objective. Since they don’t pay, they’re less competitive, and so easier to find bugs in. You can use them to practice finding common vulnerabilities and communicating with security engineers.
